<h1>How to Change a Flat Tyre</h1>
<p>The following procedure makes some assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are parked safely and on a flat surface so that you are not a danger to yourself or others while changing the tyre.</li>
<li>You have all the necessary equipment to carry out the tyre change.
<ul>
<li>A jack</li>
<li>A lug wrench</li>
<li>A fully inflated spare tyre</li>
<li>The car's owners manual</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Step 1</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Turn on your Hazard Lights</li>
<li>Remove the Jack, Lug Wrench, and Spare Tyre from the boot of your car.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Step 2</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Use the lug wrench to loosen the lug nuts
<ul>
<li>You might need to remove hubcaps before attempting this.</li>
<li><b>Note:</b> Only loosen the lug nuts. <b>Do not remove them.</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Step 3</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Position the jack under the car at the correct point on the frame
<ul>
<li><b>Note:</b> You might need the car's owners manual to locate the where to position the jack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raise the jack until the tyre you are changing is 5 to 6 inches clear of the ground.
<ul>
<li>Leave enough clearance for the fully inflated spare tyre to be put on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
