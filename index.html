<h1>How to Change a Flat Tyre</h1>
<p>The following procedure makes some assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are parked safely and on a flat surface so that you are not a danger to yourself or others while changing the tyre.</li>
<li>You have all the necessary equipment to carry out the tyre change.
<ul>
<li>A jack</li>
<li>A lug wrench</li>
<li>A fully inflated spare tyre</li>
<li>The car's owners manual</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Step 1</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Apply the parking brake.</li>
<li>Turn on your Hazard Lights.</li>
<li>Remove the Jack, Lug Wrench, and Spare Tyre from the boot of your car.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Step 2</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Use the lug wrench to loosen the lug nuts.
<ul>
<li>You might need to remove hubcaps before attempting this.</li>
<li><b>Note:</b> Only loosen the lug nuts. <b>Do not remove them.</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Step 3</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Position the jack under the car at the correct point on the frame
<ul>
<li><b>Note:</b> You might need the car's owners manual to locate where to position the jack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raise the jack until the tyre you are changing is 5 to 6 inches clear of the ground.
<ul>
<li>Leave enough clearance for the fully inflated spare tyre to be put on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Step 4</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Unscrew the lug nuts removing them from the wheel</li>
<li>Pull the tyre gently and straight towards you until it is completely free of the hub. Lie it flat to one side.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Step 5</b></p>
<ol>
<li>To put on the spare tyre, place it directly in front of the wheelarch.</li>
<li>Lift up the spare trye, lining up the rim with the lug bolts. Push the lug bolt gently through the holes on the rim.</li>
<li>Once the threads on the lug bolts are fully shown, hand tighten the lug nuts to the lug bolts.</li>
<li>Using the jack, lower the car, <b>but not fully</b>, so the full weight of the car <b>is not on the tyre</b>.</li>
<li>Take the lug wrench to tighten the lug nuts fully.
<ul>
<li>Once the lug nuts have been tightened using the wrench, use the full weight of your body to turn them to be as fully tightened as possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use the jack to completely lower the car.
<ul>
<li>Using the lug wrench, tighten the lug nuts one more time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Replace the hubcap if applicable.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Step 6</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Return all the equipment to the car boot.
<ul>
<li>Place the wheel with the punctured tyre in the boot where your spare tyre was held.</li>
<li>Place the jack and lug wrench where they are normally held in your car boot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Take the flat tyre to get repaired as soon as possible.
<ul>
<li>Some spare tyres are for temporary use and should only be driven on at a maximum speed of 80 km/h. They also wear quickly and should be replaced after a few hundred kilometres.</li>
</ul>
